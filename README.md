# Responsive portfolio

At first, Welcome to my Github account.
in this repository i have implement my own portfolio and make it responsive for all devices using CSS media query.

I made this website to share my skills and information with others.

I have used HTML5 and CSS3 for creating this portfolio.

To see my work you can click on this [URL](https://ahmedsaleh10.github.io/Responsive-Portfolio/)

## Usage
Go to URL i have mentioned it before an try it on laptop and mobile phone.
You will see the difference of layout, this difference because i have used media query. 

As you can see in this code. I have used the media query and display: flex it is so easy to fit the website and deal with it. 

```python
@media (min-width: 675px) {
  
  .container-flex {
    flex-direction: row;
    align-items: center;
  }

  main {
    width: 70%;
  }
}
```
Here any screen with width 675px or more the media query will start working, otherwise normal classes will work.
